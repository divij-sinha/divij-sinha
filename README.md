### Hey, I'm Divij!

Welcome!

👨‍💻 I'm Divij Sinha, an aspiring data scientist and policy analyst, currently enrolled in the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. 

🏛 I am currently a Research Engineer at the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, at the University of Chicago. Previously, I've had the privilege of working at the Urban Informatics Lab at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements. 

🌟 Throughout my career, I've been driven by the belief that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can be a powerful tool for public good. My experiences have spanned across data science, policy analysis, and urban informatics, each reinforcing my commitment to using data for societal improvement. 

📚 I am seeking opportunities to apply my skills in real-world settings, collaborating with peers, academics, and industry professionals. I'm particularly interested in projects at the intersection of technology, data science, and social justice, aiming to contribute to equitable and effective public policies.
