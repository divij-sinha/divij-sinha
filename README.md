### Welcome!

I'm Divij Sinha, currently in the MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. Previously, I spent time working at the Urban Informatics Lab at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements. I graduated with a major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a minor in Politics, Economics and Philosophy.

PS: My github is a little sparse and I am building it up, but code samples available on request!
